      <h4>
        Hello, I'm Daniel Contreras, and I'm 27 years old. Although I’m new to coding, I am incredibly excited about diving into this world and learning how to create software. 
        Prior to starting this bootcamp, I spent over a decade in auto parts sales. My career in this field not only honed my skills in customer service and sales but also provided 
        me with valuable business insights and experience.Transitioning into coding might seem like a big shift, but I believe my background in business will serve as a strong 
        foundation as I venture into programming. My experience in sales has taught me how to understand customer needs, manage projects, and think critically—skills that I am 
        eager to apply to developing innovative and effective software solutions. I’m enthusiastic about leveraging my business acumen to grow and develop my own programs and 
        contribute to the tech community. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead and am committed to making the most of this learning experience.
